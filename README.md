# Accelerate Runner 2

## Introduction
Accelerate IO (https://accelerate.io/index.html) was a challenge set in week 10 of the Makers course. The purpose of the task was to meet a set of user requirements that became more complex as the steps progressed. The user requirements were not always clearly defined and submitting a solution at any stage that did not meet the users understanding of the requirements, resulted in penalties. In addition the challenge was timed, so writing code that could be quickly extended was crucial.  


## Tech 
- The code is writted in `Ruby 2.2.2`
- Command line testing used `rspec`
- Continuous Integration was with `travis`
