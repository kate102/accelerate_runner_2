# ~~~~~~~~~~ The workflow ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
#   By running this file you interact with a challenge server.
#   The interaction follows a request-response pattern:
#        * You are presented with your current progress and a list of actions.
#        * You trigger one of the actions by typing it on the console.
#        * After the action feedback is presented, the execution will stop.

#   | Step | The usual workflow                                          |
#   +------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
#   |  1.  | Run this file.                                              |
#   |  2.  | Start a challenge by typing "start".                        |
#   |  3.  | Read description from the "challenges" folder               |
#   |  4.  | Implement the required method in                            |
#   |      |   ./lib/solutions                                           |
#   |  5.  | Deploy to production by typing "deploy".                    |
#   |  6.  | Observe output, check for failed requests.                  |
#   |  7.  | If passed, go to step 3.                                    |
