This folder will contain challenge descriptions.
## The Challenge 1
In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:
     sum(Integer, Integer) -> Integer
A test framework has been provided but I know that this will not help me later so I'm making my own.

## Challenge 2
In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:
     hello(String) -> String
The requirements state that the result should say hello to the world.
I am going to assume that this requires an output of 'Hello World!'

## Challenge 3
You are given the name of a friend. Say hello to them!
Example: if name of friend is "John" than return "Hello, John!".
I am going to extend the last challenge

## Challenge 4
In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:
     checkout(String) -> Integer

Where:
 - param[0] = a String containing the SKUs of all the products in the basket
 - @return = an Integer representing the total checkout value of the items
 A-D are items in a shop they each have a price and some have special offers.
 Given a string that is a basket of goods then determine the basket cost.
 Return -1 if any of the letters are not A-D

 ##Â Challenge 5
 To add more items and special OffersWe are going to sell a new item E.
 Normally E costs 40, but if you buy 2 of Es you will get B free. How cool is that ? Multi-priced items also seemed to work well so we should have more of these.
